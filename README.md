# Share2People üì¢üîó

**Share2People** is a modern API built with Laravel 11 following Clean Architecture principles. It allows users to share content such as shortlinks, links, code snippets, markdown content, and images. The API features secure JWT authentication with auto-expiring tokens and refresh support, email verification, and password reset capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Domain Layer
- **Core Models**:
    - **User**: A plain PHP object representing a user, containing fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, and timestamps.
    - **Share**: Represents shared content with attributes such as `userId`, `title`, `description`, `contentType`, etc.
- **Repository Interfaces**:
    - Define contracts for data persistence (e.g., `UserRepositoryInterface`, `ShareRepositoryInterface`).

### Application Layer
- **DTOs & UseCases**:
    - **DTOs** (e.g., `CreateUserRequestDTO`, `LoginUserRequestDTO`) transfer data between layers.
    - **UseCases** (e.g., `RegisterUserUseCase`, `LoginUserUseCase`) encapsulate business logic such as registration (with email verification) and login (with an email verification check).

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Eloquent Models**:
    - **EloquentUser**: Extends Laravel‚Äôs Authenticatable, implements `JWTSubject` and `MustVerifyEmail`, and provides email verification capabilities.
    - **EloquentShare**: Manages persistence for share content.
- **Services & Repositories**:
    - Concrete implementations for repositories and services (e.g., `EmailVerificationService`, `JWTAuthService`) are here.
- **Mappers**:
    - Map between Domain models and Eloquent models to keep the Domain layer framework-agnostic.

### Presentation Layer
- **Controllers & Requests**:
    - **AuthController**: Provides endpoints for registration, login, logout, refresh, and retrieving user details.
    - **EmailVerificationController** & **PasswordController**: Manage email verification and password resets.
    - **UserController** and **ShareController**: Handle CRUD operations.
- **Routes**:
    - Public endpoints for registration, login, email verification, and password resets; protected endpoints (using JWT middleware) for all other actions.
- **OpenAPI Documentation**:
    - Each controller is documented with Swagger annotations. Global API info and the bearer token security scheme are defined in the BaseController.
